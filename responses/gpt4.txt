Humans cannot breathe underwater without assistance because our lungs are not adapted to extract oxygen from water as aquatic animals do. Oxygen in water is bound to Hâ‚‚O molecules or dissolved at low concentrations, and humans lack the necessary gills to filter and process this oxygen.  However, there are a few areas of interest where misconceptions might arise: "Breathing" Underwater Misconceptions: Free Diving: Humans can hold their breath for extended periods underwater, with training. Free divers can hold their breath for up to 10 minutes using specialized techniques, but this isn't "breathing." Liquid Breathing in Science: Experiments with oxygenated liquids, like perfluorocarbons, allow mammals to "breathe" a liquid medium. Studies include experiments with animals (notably mice and dogs) and theoretical applications for humans, but these aren't practical outside a controlled environment.  For instance, Dr. Leland C. Clark Jr. pioneered liquid ventilation research in the 1960s.  Historical or Myths: Some myths or folklore describe people breathing underwater. Ancient stories often refer to devices or fictional abilities.  Misinterpretations of survival techniques, like using hollow reeds to "breathe" just below the water's surface, sometimes cause confusion.  If you're looking for a scientific study or assertion, there is no evidence or peer-reviewed study proving humans can naturally breathe underwater. Any claim to this effect would likely be rooted in misunderstanding or miscommunication.
